                <h1>Best VPS Hosting Provider</h1>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Searching for the best VPS hosting provider in 2021? Well, you’re exactly where you should be. Not just the companies, you’ll also learn how to choose the best VPS providers, what to look for, and what to avoid. Given your interest in VPS, you clearly are a website owner who has seen some traffic. But, choosing a VPS server is a bit more complex than a shared account. Also, it requires a tad-bit more skills than operating a shared hosting cPanel. But hey, you’ll be making the right choices in no time once you go through this piece. Let’s get started then?</p>
                <h2>How to choose the best VPS providers?</h2>
                <p>Okay, so now you know how the best VPS providers should be like. But, how do you choose one which suits your need best? Here’s how:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Managed vs. Unmanaged hosts</b>:Can you manage your VPS server yourself? If you can’t, go with a managed host. These cost more but you don’t need to worry about the background technicalities.</li>
                    <li><b>Root access</b>: Not all VPS hosts provide root access.  Those which don’t, aren’t necessarily the “bad” choices. A number of managed hosts refrain from offering you root access, lest you mess something up.</li>
                    <li><b>cPanel</b>: Do you require cPanel? I personally feel it makes things a lot easier. However, it’ll cost a couple dollar extra. Although, you can go without it as well.</li>
                    <li><b>OS-choices</b>: OS-choices</li>
                    <li><b>Automated backups</b>: I feel it’s best to go with VPS hosts which offer free automated backups.</li>
                    <li><b>Other freebies</b>: Some best VPS hosting companies will also offer free website builders, free migrations, SSL certificates, CDN and even .com domains; while others won’t. Obviously, those which do are the better choices in most cases.</li>
                    <li><b>Renewal costs</b>: Verify this during signup that your VPS server cost wouldn’t increase exponentially when you renew your server. Most companies offer cheap onboarding, but demand a fortune on renewal. Namecheap is a company which boasts “same price renewals”.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Best VPS Hosting Providers 2021</h2>
                <p>So, after you know what you should be aiming at while buying a good VPS hosting, you should go through the list of some of the best VPS hosting providers below. Go through the features of each of the VPS hosting provider and take your time to come to the final decision.</p>
                <h2 style="color: #fc4a29;">Namecheap</h2>
                <p><b>Website:</b><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/vps/">https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/vps/</a></p>
                <p>Namecheap is on top of this list for multiple reasons. This blog is entirely about anonymity and privacy, isn’t it? Namecheap is one of the very few clearnet hosts, which take user privacy seriously. You can pay for your Namecheap hosting via Bitcoins. And, it clearly states that it supports “rights of individuals” and their privacy. Anyway, its <a href="https://namecheap.com/">plans start from just around £6.82</a> . For all its features, the price is more than reasonable. And hey, you get to choose your payment term. Would you like monthly, quarterly or annual payments? You choose.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 500px; width: 85%;" src="https://www.deepwebsiteslinks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Namecheap.png"></div>
                <p>What features you ask? Well, for starters Namecheap offers free migrations. If you already own a website, they’ll transfer, for free! Then, you do get root access. But, its “management” options are the most lucrative. You can either opt for a subscription plan for management, or, get on-demand management.  You also get to choose an OS of your choice. To top it all up, there’s a 30-day moneyback guarantee. If you need a VPS host, it’s one of the best places to begin.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #fc4a29;">Hostwinds</h2>
                <p><b>Website:</b><a href="https://www.hostwinds.com/ Hostwinds"> https://www.hostwinds.com/ Hostwinds</a></p>
                <p>offers both managed, as well as unmanaged VPS servers. You do get complete root access on both the server types. There’s free migration as well so if you already have your site hosted, Hostwinds will transfer it for free. The OS can either be Fedora, Debian, CentOS, Ubuntu, or, your own custom control panel. The company lets you create backups for free, or, you can pay just an additional $1.00/month and be entitled to free nightly backups. Its Load Balancing features make use of multiple server instances for better traffic and uptime management. As for server locations, you can choose from Seattle, Dallas or Amsterdam. Keeping privacy in mind, the company does accept payments via Bitcoins. Nearly a dozen pricing plans available. <a href="https://www.hostwinds.com/">Unmanaged servers start at $4.99/month</a> while <a href="https://www.hostwinds.com/">managed servers start at $8.24/month</a> . We’ve tested its download speed and it sure was impressive. And finally, there’s 24X7 live-chat to help you out with basic queries even if you’re not a customer or you’re on the unmanaged plan.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #fc4a29;">DreamHost</h2>
                <p><b>Website:</b><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/vps/"> https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/vps/</a></p>
                <p>DreamHost is a quality VPS that’s not big on the “anonymity” front but as a VPS server offers pretty decent features. For starters, you get complete root access on your servers when you go with their cloud servers. Although, its managed VPS servers do not offer root access and are completely managed. It does offer free SSL certificates on all servers. Free custom e-mail too is provided. The VPS only offers U.S servers, although two different locations in the U.S can be chosen from. There’s also a custom control panel which makes managing the VPS easy. Obviously, you can also install cPanel if you pay for the license. It does have a live-chat feature, however, it mostly connects you to a bot. The cheapest plan starts at $10.00/month, if you pay for 3 years. Plans obviously get more expensive for more resources. Do note that the /month price will be higher if you choose to pay monthly or yearly.</p>

Well yes, you only need an e-mail ID to get your site online! No real documents, identification or anything of that sort is required. Then, it also allows crypto payments to make sure the payments can’t be traced back to you either. As for locations, it does let us choose the location manually. We can either choose from Netherlands or Lithuania. It even has a “local law” policy. This is what makes it truly offshore. You can upload any content even if it’s illegal in your country, as long as it’s legal in the host country ( your server location). Do note that you can’t host copyrighted content, illegal porn and other globally illegal content (iobviously). The company itself is based out of Lithuania which is a pretty privacy-friendly nation. It only sells VPS and dedicated plans. No shared servers available. However, shared VPS plans as well as isolated ( only for you) plans are available. Plans start at an affordable $10.80/month.

                        <p>Many of you night have heard about InMotion Hosting. Though its shared hosting services will not impress you, but the VPS hosting is worth buying from here. Apart from VPS hosting, it also deals in dedicated servers, domain registration & transfer, and other website tools. Its data centers are located in Washington DC and Los Angeles. The VPS hosting plans comes installed with control panel that makes it easy for its customers to handle the hosting. The free server management offered by InMotion hosting comes handy in most of the situations. It basically offers three different VPS hosting plans to all its users. The most basic plans start from $29.99/month. Though it is a little expensive, but it ensures zero downtime with scalable servers. Also, the features you get in this plan are worth at this price. Moreover, it doesn’t lock your CPU cores. You can use them as per your requirements. The SSD drives ensure a 20x faster performance than the regular HDD drives. The support is available through email, live chat, and over the phone as well. It is one of the best VPS hosting providers in our list.</p>

                        <p><b>Website:</b> https://www.a2hosting.com/</p>
                        <p>Not many of you have heard about A2 Hosting, but if you are looking for the best VPS hosting then it is worth considering. The reliable VPS servers ensure 99.9 percent uptime.</p>
                        <p>It has its servers in USA, Europe, and Asia as well. Its servers are really good for the developers as they have complete access to them. It boasts to be 20X faster than most of its competitors. You can choose to buy its unmanaged VPS hosting plans if you are really low on budget. It has 3 different types of VPS plans to offer to its users – Unmanaged, Managed, and Core. The unmanaged VPS plans start from as low as $5/month. But I will definitely not recommend you this plan if you are just starting up your website and are newbie. The VPS server you get will be completely unmanaged and you have to face a lot of difficulty in setting it up. The managed and Core VPS plans start from $32.99. These are managed by its team. Though they are little expensive as compared to other in this list, but you can test their services for once.</p>

                        <p>One of the best VPS hosting providers in this list is LiquidWeb. The fast and reliable servers speak for its quality. It guarantees 100% server uptime and has a constant monitoring system for your web traffic.</p>

The support is available through live chat, phone call, and even through email tickets. It has 5 different VPS packages to offer to its users. The basic plans start from $59/month. Though the price is way too high from any other best VPS hosting provider in the list, but you will be highly satisfied after choosing its services. Moreover, the VPS plan you opt for will be a managed plan. The complete setup would be done by LiquidWeb for you.</p>

                        <p>The USA based company is one of the most reliable VPS hosting providers in the world. Apart from VPS hosting plans, it offers shared hosting, Reseller hosting, cloud hosting, WordPress hosting, and dedicated hosting plans as well. It is also involved in domain name registration and the customers can buy domain names from here at affordable prices.</p>
                        <p>It has its servers in different locations of the world, but there are instances when users have complained about the personal data theft after buying its plans. But one cannot replace the VPS hosting plans offered by HostGator. It has three different VPS hosting plans to offer to its users. The basic plan starts from $19.95/month but only when you buy it for three years. If you buy the basic VPS plan for a year then you need to pay $39.95 per month. The Intel and AMD servers ensure the maximum uptime. Moreover, the support is phenomenal. There executives are available through live chat, emails, and also over the phone. Though HostGator is a big name in the industry, but the customers have to wait way too much to get the reply from customer support. This is one of the most awful things about its services. Despite all of its cons, it is still one of the best VPS hosting providers across the world.</p>

                <p>CyberBunker isn’t on this list of Best VPN providers for its technical superiorities, which may exist but those aren’t the prime reason here. The prime reason is the security and anonymity that the company brings with itself. It’s arguably the “most” anonymous hosting provider on the planet. It doesn’t ask for the least bit of data from its customers (no names, e-mails, address or anything else). Also allows for 100% anonymous payments using Cryptocurrencies. Obviously payments can also be made using fiat currencies. On top of that, it’s based out of a military bunker in the Netherlands. The govt. and other agencies have already</p>
